# DecisionTrees
Predicting Student Loan Defaults Using Decision Trees
Our data set for this assignment contains  2000 rows of student loan data with features like :study field, selective college, loan amount etc. Steps we followed in order to create a decision tree classifier :

- Load dataset and perform explanatory data analysis.
- Convert categorical values into numerical and drop features we will not need.
- Train-Validation-Test split.
- Fit and validate DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree with default settings. (accuracy : 82 %)
- Optimise our classifier by finding which parameters are most accurate and change them. (accuracy : 88 %)
